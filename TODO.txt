Immediate:
- More than ZQSD, maybe PlayerPrefs as well //ok but no playerPrefs yet (for the Settings from mainMenu)
- Enemies occupy the tile they move to while moving instead of the old one until end of movement (as currently)


Moderate:
- Main Menu
- Different static random Levels, increasing in difficulty (currently I only have one reasonably difficult)
- Sounds
- Dynamic levels, with spawning enemies
- Story mode ?
- Items and power-ups ?
- Differend kinds of enemies ?


Hard:
- Level Editor

Features Fix:
- Reset Inputs when pause/unpause (and not take any when paused)
- 

Post-Poning Features That Would Be Really Nice To Have:
- Instead of a rather ugly BigBall(r), a werewolf-type arm
